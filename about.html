        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>virtually Art is a AR gallery ideate by Bea Taylor Searle and John Moffatt.</p>
        <p>The gallery concept unhindered by geography, economics, or
            the sanitized confines of the previous generation of gallery spaces: Seeking
            out new ways of curating, experiencing, and interacting with contemporary
            artists and their practices.
            In this post-covid world, many of us are revaluating the implications of a life
            lived in the rat race, as the dramatic changes we have experienced in home
            and work life continue to reverberate around us. No longer is it seen as
            inevitable, that life should be dictated by old ways of thinking – our homes,
            gardens, parks, and many other spaces, became our studios, offices, and
            workplaces, and now, our Galleries.
            We begin this journey with our first Virtually ARt event here in the Lethaby
            Gallery, July 2021, presenting graduating students Bea Taylor-Searle, John
            Moffatt, Alice Bajaj, Joshanne Dar, Julia Tröscher, Saeideh Amirian &
            Catherine Rose Lavender from Central Saint Martins BA Fine Art class of
            2021.
            In September 2021 we will be launching our second event along with the
            official apps. For exclusive access to this event, you can download the pre-
            Alpha app from our website onto your Android device (iOS not supported
            for this version) or join the mailing list to be notified when to download it
            from your app store.</p>
